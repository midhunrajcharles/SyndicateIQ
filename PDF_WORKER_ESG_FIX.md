# PDF Worker & ESG Analysis Fix - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. PDF.js Worker Setup (Vite-Compatible)
- **Before**: Used CDN worker (unreliable, CSP issues, offline problems)
- **After**: Local worker using Vite's `?url` import (production-safe, offline-capable)

### 2. ESG Analysis Engine
- **New Feature**: Automated ESG signal detection from extracted PDF text
- **Capabilities**: Environmental, Social, and Governance scoring
- **Output**: Risk levels, insights, and detected signals

## 🔧 Changes Made

### File: `src/lib/utils/pdfExtractor.ts`
**Fixed worker setup:**
```typescript
// OLD (CDN - unreliable)
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/${pdfjsLib.version}/pdf.worker.min.js`;

// NEW (Vite-compatible local worker)
import workerSrc from 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js?url';
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = workerSrc;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No CDN dependency
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No CSP (Content Security Policy) issues
- ✅ Production-safe
- ✅ Faster loading

### File: `src/lib/utils/esgAnalyzer.ts` (NEW)
**Created ESG analyzer with:**
- Environmental signal detection (renewable energy, carbon, emissions, etc.)
- Social signal detection (diversity, safety, community, etc.)
- Governance signal detection (audit, board, risk management, etc.)
- Risk level calculation (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Insights generation
- Detected signals tracking

### File: `src/pages/DocumentProcessing.tsx`
**Added ESG integration:**
- ESG analysis runs automatically after PDF text extraction
- Beautiful UI display with:
  - Three score cards (Environmental, Social, Governance)
  - Risk level badge with color coding
  - Key insights list
  - Detected signals badges

## 🚀 How It Works

### Complete Pipeline:

```
1. User uploads PDF
   ↓
2. Extract text (PDF.js with local worker)
   ↓
3. Analyze ESG signals (automated detection)
   ↓
4. Parse with AI (Claude API)
   ↓
5. Display results:
   - Loan document data
   - ESG analysis scores
   - Risk assessment
   - Insights
```

## 📊 ESG Analysis Features

### Environmental Signals Detected:
- Renewable energy (solar, wind)
- Carbon emissions (CO2, greenhouse gas)
- Sustainability initiatives
- Water/waste management
- Climate action

### Social Signals Detected:
- Employee relations & training
- Diversity & inclusion
- Safety standards
- Community engagement
- Human rights
- Labor practices

### Governance Signals Detected:
- Audit oversight
- Board governance
- Risk management
- Policy framework
- Ethics & transparency
- Compliance

### Risk Level Calculation:
- **LOW**: Score ≥ 60% (180+ points)
- **MEDIUM**: Score 30-59% (90-179 points)
- **HIGH**: Score < 30% (< 90 points)

## 🎨 UI Features

### ESG Results Display:
1. **Three Score Cards**
   - Environmental (green theme)
   - Social (blue theme)
   - Governance (purple theme)
   - Each shows: Score out of 100, detected signals

2. **Risk Level Badge**
   - Color-coded (green/yellow/red)
   - Total score display (X / 300)

3. **Key Insights**
   - List of detected signals
   - Overall score percentage
   - Signal categories found

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Complete Flow:

1. **Upload a PDF with ESG content:**
   - Should detect environmental signals
   - Should show social initiatives
   - Should identify governance framework

2. **Upload a PDF without ESG content:**
   - Should show low scores
   - Should indicate "No ESG signals detected"
   - Should show HIGH risk level

3. **Verify Worker Works:**
   - Check browser console (no CDN errors)
   - Works offline (after initial load)
   - No CSP warnings

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Worker Setup:
- The `?url` suffix is a Vite feature
- Automatically handles worker bundling
- Works in both dev and production builds

### ESG Analysis:
- Runs synchronously after text extraction
- No API calls required (local analysis)
- Fast and reliable
- Can be enhanced with ML models later

### Integration:
- ESG analysis happens before AI parsing
- Results are displayed alongside loan data
- Both use the same extracted text

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **ML-Based ESG Analysis:**
   - Train model on ESG reports
   - More accurate signal detection
   - Context-aware scoring

2. **ESG Trend Analysis:**
   - Compare across multiple documents
   - Track improvements over time
   - Generate ESG reports

3. **Due Diligence Integration:**
   - Auto-fill ESG forms
   - Risk scoring integration
   - Compliance checking
